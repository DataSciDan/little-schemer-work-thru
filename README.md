# The Little Schemer work through #

This is code obtained by working through the book *The Little Schemer* by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen. Some of the code is lifted directly from the book (functions so generic that there is no risk of copyright infringement), and some of it I wrote. I gained a lot from working through the book, but I most especially appreciate having recursive functions become a normal, comfortable thing to devise. I highly recommend it to all programmers.

This repo should be helpful to anyone who worked through the book and wants to review everything without working through it again.
